#### Problem
There's no existing public-facing water quality testing program available to private-property owners in Leon County. 

#### Solution
Leon's Soil and Water Conservation District partners with the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering to develop a free or low-cost water quality testing program for private-property owners in Leon County, prioritizing residents within a 1-mi radius of impaired water bodies. 

#### Test Cases
1. A property-owner in Capitola with the St. Marks River running through their backyard.

#### End Product
A visual inventory, in the form of an interactive map, of water quality in Tallahassee-Leon County

#### Goals:
- to find pollution hotspots
- to identify options to either treat water or reduce/trap pollution before it travels downstream
- Connect owners to TAPP or other resources offered by the City/County/State
